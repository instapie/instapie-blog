      <h1>The InstaPie Blog</h1>

<h2>August 16, 2013</h2>

<p>For my final project in grad school I created a little iOS app called <a href="http://www.instapie.net/">InstaPie</a>. It was fun, and some of my friends were excited about the idea; but work and other things ended up getting in the way and I never did very much with it. I had a Padrino app running on Heroku, and a beta iOS app that a few people downloaded through <a href="https://testflightapp.com/">TestFlight</a>. That was it. And then I made some changes to the API and broke the iOS app.</p>

<p>Well, I'm starting over. And this time around I'm going to do some things differently:</p>

<ul><li contenteditable="true">First, I'm using Rails 4 instead of Padrino. I really like Padrino because of its relative slimness, and because it does provide a nice interface (being built on Sinatra) for a lot of useful functionality. But I think at this point I'm willing to accept that for a large website--for some definition of "large"--it makes more sense to use a beefier framework. And I'm liking Rails 4 so far.</li><li contenteditable="true">Originally I hosted the code in a private repo on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>. I'm just going to <a href="https://github.com/instapie/instapie">embrace open source</a> this time. I don't think there's any compelling reason <em>not</em> to, and this way there's always the potential for others to contribute. There's a psychological reasoning here too: I think by exposing the code publicly, I'll take more pride in it and will actually strive to maintain a higher level of quality. That is just a hypothesis, though; we'll see how it plays out.</li><li contenteditable="true">For the mobile side of things, I'm thinking of trying out a cross-platform solution like <a href="https://github.com/calatrava/calatrava">Calatrava</a>, which is the work of some of my former colleagues at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>. In fact, I have something especially ambitious in mind on this front: I actually have a Windows Phone as my personal device, so developing an InstaPie app with Calatrava would be a perfect opportunity to add WP8 support to the project. But that could be way too much to take on; again, we'll see.</li></ul>

<p>Anyway, right now the semi-latest version of the (web portion of the) app is running at <a href="http://beta.instapie.net/">beta.instapie.net</a>. Don't bother creating an account or anything like that unless you just want to play around; I will be regularly clearing the database and making all kinds of breaking changes at first.</p>
